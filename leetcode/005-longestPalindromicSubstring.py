# Problem: Longest Palindromic Substring
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/
# Solved on: 2024-07-07

# Time complexity: O(nÂ²)
# Description: This function expands around each character and pair of characters to find all possible palindromes.
# The longest palindrome found during these expansions is returned.
