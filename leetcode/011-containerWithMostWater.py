# Solved on: 2024-06-28


# Time complexity: O(nÂ²)
# Description: This function employs a brute-force approach to solve the Container With Most Water problem.
# It iterates through all possible pairs of elements in the list to find the maximum container

# Description: This function uses two pointers (p and q) to find two numbers that has the max
# container. It adjusts the pointers based on whether is the smaller height.
